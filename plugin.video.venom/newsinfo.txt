[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Thought I'd report things on my to-do list
    that are currently part done and being worked on.
    I hope some might comment so I can put things
    into priority. So it goes like this[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] - 1.) Uncached torrent removal.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] - 2.) Global context menu options.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] - 2.) Add season pack ability.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] - 2.) add service, and option to enable, to
    notify user of new updates for those that turn
    off auto updates.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Wow, I did not realize it's been months
    since I added comments here.  I wanted to inform
    people at this current time there are issues with
    TMDb user lists.  It seems that some users have
    reported to TMDb that titles are being dropped
    from their lists.  I noticed in the Movies-Collections
    many lists seem to now have missing titles so I'm
    hit with this new issue myself.  I reported this to
    TMDb and it's been confirmed and they are
    looking into it.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]July 25, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Working on a new Trakt list where it will
    follow our "Page Item Limit" setting and this should
    give a huge boost to large Trakt list for users
    complaining they are slow.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Eventually the plan is to get all Trakt lists
    to and indepndent py file to avoid the chaos exo
    forks make mashing the code all together and
    using a final function called super_info() to
    resolve all missing data for far to many variants.
    I'm sorry to say to any devs working on an exo
    fork that this just fails terribly. They never
    developened a "next" page ability for things like
    large Trakt list over a 100 items and we are trying
    to gather that data and load it.  Not a real prob for
    8yr old code lacking modern bells and whistles.
    A pretty decent slow down can be seen in these large
    Trakt list trying trying to add any kind of modren
    features sets so	what is needs is "Page Item Limits"
    for these large lists.  A bit of work but that's my next plan[/I]

[B][COLOR red]July 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More additions to try and speed up menu load
    times so please experiment with the new options for
    "Season Count" and "Unwatched Count".  Personally
    I like seeing this added info but it does add an api call
    and impacts load times.  Also if you flip these on or off
    please remember you need to clear cache, meta and
    cache option at a min.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Had a little issue with someone messing with
    "view types' and did not know how to cure the setting
    they chose.  What I decided to do was enhance the
    "Reset View Types" option to now include flushing
    of the Kodi cache for "viewMode6.db".  Keep in mind
    this will now reset every single view type to skin default
    and wipe the data from Kodi as well.  It's actually the
    preferable method for a proper reset.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I actually fixed the HEVC filtering last update
     and forgot to include that in the changelog.  What I
     discovered today was the filtering was done after the
     source links were counted so you saw all kind of gaps
     in the link count list.  I now moved the code to where it
     should be to not effect the count and labels.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I've turned back on caching of Trakt Progress
    list for speed.  First users complained the list did not
    update for episodes they just finished watching so I
    removed the caching duration so it would update
    instantly but this came at a cost...slow down and it
    comes with the territory folks and you can not have it
    both ways.  I've come to realize the complaints of speed
    out weigh the folks wanting it updated instantly so some
    of you lose.  No more discussions on it either!![/I]

[B][COLOR red]July 06, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trying to speed up menu load times so please
    experiment with the new options for "Page Item Limit" and
    "Disable Extended artwork(fanart.tv).  I'm currently using
    a Page Limit of 10, yes you heard that right.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Disabling Extended artwork seems to have the
    biggest impact on TMDb lists at this time.  I watched a 20
    listitem page go from 8 seconds to 4 seconds by turning
    this new feature off.  Ironically IMDb lists had .75 seconds
    load time improvement.  IMDb parses web page due to
    IMDb not having an api.  TMDb's api is in use so I'm not
    sure if two consecutive api requests cause this large delay
    or not but it sure looks to be the case.  I plan to investigate
    this further info.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The most notable loss to using "Disable Extended
    artwork" will be no clearart or discart retrieved.  This is
    seen during playback seek or pause.  The clearart generally
    appears on the right side of the player.  Discart is used by
    some skins to show a DVD pop out of the poster artwork.
    If this artwork is of no importance to you I suggest turning
    this new option off.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]June 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] UpNext integration info.
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Please note this release requires the latest release
    of UpNext, version 1.0.1, that can be found in the Kodi
    repo and was released on un 18, 2019.  Version 1.0.0
    has a few communication issues that were esolved in
    1.0.1.  You will notice occasional missing UpNext
    notifications with v1.0.0 so please be sure to check
    this.  Thank you Ian for resolving this issue!![/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] For now the best way to use UpNext is with the Kodi
    context menu option "Play from Here" or from within
    the "Playlist Manager" - "View Playlist"[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Previously all exo forks refused to close the episode
    list items if you used "Play from Here" so this play
    method for me became annoying.  I've fixed this
    and episode list items, and playlist, now close. [/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Due to the above I was forced to hard code Auto Play
    for Episodes.  This was needed for the "Play from
    Here" context menu option to work in continual
    episode play of an entire season.  If you select
    a single episode only that episode will play, but
    with Auto Play still in effect.  If you disable UpNext
    this removes the hard code. If you wish to bypass
    Auto Play for a single episode I suggest using the
    context menu option "Select Source" for the item
    you wish to single play without Auto Play enabled[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The Auto playlist creation is on by default and this is
    done behind closed doors with no effect on
    performance at all.  You can try with and without
    this feature on and you will not notice even the
    slightest difference so I suggest leaving it on.
    At this time the only thing this does is when you
    enter a Season the playlist will create a full episode
    list for the given Season you entered only.  Entering
    the "Playlist Manager" you could view, edit,  and
    play this list. Future plans for this playlist as well.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] The goal for next update is to get the playlist to play
    from a single episode selection, so you won't
    have to use "Play from Here" but at this time I'm
    dealing with a bit of a bug calling this playlist for
    direct play.  I also want to add a pre-scrape ability
    so next episode play is instant without a visible
    scrape process, but timing it the scrape takes
    about 3-5secs for the next episode to play as
    it is now so I didn't holdback this release[/I]
