The <reuselanguageinvoker> element is a feature introduced with Kodi 18.0 that changes the way the python invoker works in Kodi - trying to reuse the invoker instances as much as possible. As a result, the addon performance is greatly improved. Please note that instability issues may occur due to reported bugs in this new implementation.  Test on your own!!!
