If you have a PM or RD account do not waste you time turning all scrapers on.  This will seriously slow down your scrape process to play time.  Personally I have both and turn on a few free hosters that specifically offer TVShow/Episodes for the hard to find older shows.  I do not use a single Premium Hoster.  At most I turn on is 10 torrents and that is more than enough.  I also strongly suggest getting a Filepursuit api key and using that.  I'm a total Preemptive termination/Auto Play junkie and scrape to play time for me is 5 seconds on average.  In time I may offer a Venom suggested Fenomscrapers settings to try.  Do not get carried away turning on a slew of scrapers, you're only wasting time doing so.
