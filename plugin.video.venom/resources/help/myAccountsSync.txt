If you changed account information in the [COLOR red][B]"My Accounts"[/B][/COLOR] addon outside of Venom you need to sync the new account information back to Venom with the [COLOR red][B]"sync(re) with My Accounts"[/B][/COLOR] option.  If you made changed via the [COLOR red][B]"Open My Accounts Addon"[/B][/COLOR] here in Venom's settings, or Venom's UI, then this process is done for you.  A visible notification will alert you of the auto sync process.
