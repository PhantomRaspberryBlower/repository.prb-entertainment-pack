This option allows showing the unwatched count for multi episode lists.  However to do so means tricking kodi into thinking the list items are TVShow items. Skins display this a bit differently from one to another, and some labels may not display.  The skin may also show different content depending on the view type chosen for that skin.  It's best to test this option with your skin and view type chosen.
