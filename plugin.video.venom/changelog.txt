[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.7 - Nov. 06, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVShows Season level watched indicators.
    Previously the Season level did not refresh the cached
    watch status upon detection of a playcount change, this
    is now fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new startup service to detect a mismatch
    in the current reuselanguageinvoker setting vs. an update
    change.  Upon change detection user will be presented
    with the option to revert or accept the new setting.  Any
    change made and the users profile will be reloaded.
    There is no longer a need to restart Kodi as this is now
    done via reloading users profile.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added check for Google Drive account.  If present,
    and no debrid account exists, user will not longer be
    presented with a notification that a debrid account is
    required since these are direct playable links.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New "traktSync.db" has been added. When user
    enables the "Trakt" category setting "Enable scrobbling",
    and also sets "Resume Point source" to "Trakt scrobbles",
    an initial sync will retrieve your complete Trakt Progress for
    all Movies and Shows.  At any time playback is stopped,
    before the normal 85% for "mark as watched", the
    scrobble pause will be saved to local db as well as sent
    to Trakt to maintain synchronization.  A service check is
    performed at 15 minute intervals to compare the latest
    "paused_at" db entry with that from the Trakt api.  This
    assures that another device in your home will get
    updated for changes.  This maintains sync across
    multiple devices.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] For the item above a new option has been added
    to the "Trakt Manager" called "Scrobble Reset".  This
    removes the given item from the local db and sends
    "progress=0" to Trakt "scrobble/start".  A 
    "container.refresh()" is then issued so 
    the changes are seen instantly.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.6 - Oct. 13, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed settings for remove uncached torrents. Under
    some conditions an item my be unavailable for AD, PM,
    or RDd torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed AD cache check when a single item from a
    list request contained an error the cache check process
    halted.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reduced the number of visible named scrapers
    for the progressDialog.  AuraMod skin had a slight overlap
    with the progress bar.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.5 - Oct. 09, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed cache check setting for AD, PM, and RD,
    this is now hard coded on to always check cached status.
    You can still enable/disable showing of uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed setting to enable/disable pack scraping.
    This is now hard coded on.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fix for random container refresh issues
    during playback.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fix for Furk resolve issue.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.4 - Oct. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]

    and "New Episodes".  All items were currently availalbe.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed a few menu items.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Code changes for "My Accounts" changes.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.3 - Oct. 01, 2020[/COLOR][/B]

    uses "My Accounts" and was missed in previous updates.[/I]

    of available space.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Code cleanup and removal of logging from previous
    version.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.2.2 - Sept. 29, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed seven instances of missing ID's in settings.xml.  This
    just caused a constant cleaning of these 7 items that were
    never called or referenced.  This now avoids that notice.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed scraper progress dialog displaying to many scraper
    names for skins with small progress dialogs.  Names will not
    display until the remaining count reaches 6.[/I]

    due to limited time to maintain.  Premium hosters supported
    by AD, PM, and RD is still supported.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New scraper pack called "Fenom Scrapers" per above
    changes and OpenScrapers is no longer to be maintained.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Venom now integrates with a new addon to access your
    account information called "My Accounts".  My Accounts
    allows any addon to access the authorized info so if
    adopted by other developers it would eliminate the
    need to authorize in every addon you use.
    This does however require a new initial setup.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed missing download option for premium hosters.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed library imports where disabled notifications would
    prematurely terminate the import process.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed invalid characters displayed in source select.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Source select has been re-written for the removal of

    in place and includes an elapsed timer count.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New bookmark options to use exist local bookmarks
    or Trakt scrobble.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.5 - Sept. 13, 2020[/COLOR][/B]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.2 - Sept. 05, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed hosters not displayed from previous update.  Hoster
    support may be removed is the near future.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.1 - Sept. 04, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with fresh install failing with log error notice.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.1.0 - Sept. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "File Name Format" option to downloads.  You
    have the option of "Title (year) or Title S01E01", which is
    the older file naming method.  Or you can chose
    "torrent file name".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed random issue where meta fallback would replace
    "tvshowtitle" with episode "title".  This caused issues with
    OpenInfo or TMDbHelper failing lookup of the show.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed playback issue with OpenInfo where video playing
    was in background.  This occurred when a search was
    performed first and then accessing OpenInfo to play
    from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed PM expiry date when viewing Account Info.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for cache checking and
    removal of uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for resolving of pack files
    for playback.[/I]

    cache uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for downloading from source
    select.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added All Debrid support for "Browse Debrid Pack".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed "My Movies" "Date Added" sorting.  Previously it
    was stuck at descending sort order due to Trakt api key
    for "listed_at" was not assigned.  This is now fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed "Unfinished" in My Movies and My TV Shows
    to "Continue Watching".  Limit has been reduced to 40
    items. Trakt On Deck is now removed as this was the
    same list with only 20 items so I feel this was a good
    compromise. Sort order is now set to be based on date
    paused.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] "reuselanguageinvoker" is now officially hard coded on.
    There is a new service settings management system
    courtesy of Tikipeter,  so credit goes to him!!![/I]  There
    is still an option for user to turn this off if not comfortable. 
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TVShows Originals is now on
    by default.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Youtube is now on by default.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Please be sure to update "context.venom" to v1.0.6 for
    compliant changes.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.8 - Aug. 23, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed episode unaired condition when meta
    provider does not return a premiered date.  The
    item is now considered unaired.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Real-Debrid to the new "Premium Services"
    menu.  You can view, play, download, and manage
    your RD account from here.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a new setting that allows user to flip and test
    kodi 18's new setting called "reuselanguageinvoker" that
    greatly improves the performance of the addon.
    Option is found under the "Debugging-Developer Mode".
    You must enable Developer mode for option to be visible.
    Note that this is an experimental feature you can test.
    It has been reported that this can cause kodi to crash
    and seems to effect widgets.  The issue has been posted
    to Team Kodi's github so it's on them to fix it. I'm not
    discussing this experimental inclusion beyond this.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Many code changes for the above have taken place
    to comply with its requirements.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.7 - Aug. 15, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with free hosters not showing in source
    select.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new "Premium Services" menu.  At this time
    only Premiumize.me is fully functional.  I had no
    intention of releasing this till PM, RD, and AD was
    complete but the item list above bit me in the ass.
    You can view, play, and manage your cloud account
    from here.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Context Menu option "Cache to cloud" for
    selected uncached torrent provided seeder count
    is not 0 for the selected item.  If you have uncached
    torrents removed this option is not available at this
    time.  I'm considering adding a yes-no dialog to load
    uncached torrents if no sources found and user has
    removed uncached torrents.  This would give you an
    opportunity to cache an item to your cloud.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.6 - Aug. 05, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with "Watched Count" setting dropping
    show-seasons that do not contain a valid imdb_id.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed db issue for shows mentioned above.  This also
    caused issues in rare cases that the very next
    episode scraped also did not contain a valid 
    imdb_id the returned sources would include
    previous scrape.  This is now fixed and invalid
    imdb_id entries are wiped from the db.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed Pack scraping option to ON by default
    and changed OpenScrapers dependency to required
    version to comply. Previous installs will not change.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "sample" to filter string for packs files to ignore
    in resolving.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.5 - Aug. 05, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added 2 new string format checks for resolving
    pack files due to some rare and rather odd internal
    episode naming conventions used.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed a torrent caching expiry issue preventing a fresh
    scrape under some situations.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.4 - Aug. 02, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Sorry folks completely forgot about .strm library file
    playback with the new pack file work, they were badly
    broken.  This is now fixed including resolving of pack
    files from library as well.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.3 - Aug. 02, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Pack file size calc. function.  This will
    take the current pack file and calculate the approx. size
    of each episode inside the pack.  This will also vary
    based on show Packs that are ranges ex. 1-7 when
    there are 9 total season.  Only season 1-7 will be
    accounted for in that case.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.2 - July 30, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Switched IMDb year check for titles to api request for
    small 1/2-3/4 second savings to scrape startup.  Thanks
    for the tip on that hidden api Mr.Anonymous!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Code cleanup of forgotten logging.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0.1 - July 30, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed pack file resolving when "Directory"
    source select mode is chosen.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with TMDBHelper passing
    plot that contains quotes.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v4.0 - July 26, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Pack scraping support added.  This is off by default so
    enable under "Source Options". Resolving support for
    RD and PM only at this time.  Special thanks to Tikipeter
    for his collaboration in this project!!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "is_airing" for seasons containing unaired
    episodes. This flag will avoid seasonPack scraping for
    seasons that are still airing, which returns nothing
    but incomplete season packs anyway.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added the ability to view pack files via context menu
    option courtesy of TikiPeter. You can pick and play
    any video content.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Dev mode" to "Debugging" settings section.
    Please DO NOT USE.  This is for my own testing of
    scrapers to enable or disable and isolate issues.  I
    will not field questions or speak of this section.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added IMDb check for titles and year, just prior to
    scraping.  A number of titles the meta from trakt and
    tmdb differ from IMDb by a year, ex.
    "Dragged Across Concrete" and "Oculus".  Some titles also differ,
    ex. "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" vs.
    "Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Season count is now hard coded ON.  Previously
    a trakt api request was used to fetch total season
    and the need to disable for speed was apparent.
    Now the season count is parsed from and counted
    from the tvdb v1 api xml files already received so
    there is no longer a need to disable.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed Season0 from season count when option is
    enabled.  Season count will no longer include
    Season0 regardless of setting.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TV Specials (Season0) to default "false"(off).[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed  function cache scraping from library .strm files.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added alias title check matching to scraped query results[/I]

    deemed confusing.  I will add more upon request[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with one item in Trakt progress not showing
    show title.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added option for multi episode lists to show or not show
     unwatched count.  See new Help for more info[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.7.3 - May 31, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue where if fanart.tv was disabled it prevented
    loading of seasons list.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.7.2 - May 30, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new TVDB api key selection between 3 possible
    keys.  It was discovered today that some keys seem to
    drop random shows loading a season list, and that
    happens rarely in itself.  This server anomaly eventually
    clears up in a day or so but flipping to a different key
    seems to also cure the problem more immediate for
    those that can no wait.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.7.1 - May 29, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Set tmdb to str() in tmdb module. This broke setting
    the new .setProperty('tmdb_id', tmdb). Can not be an int().[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.7.0 - May 29, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Increased Find Similar list to 20 items vs. 10.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed tagline for shows.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added missing clearlogo and clearart at season level.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Unwatched count now only added to multi episode
    lists like Progress and Calendar.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added .setProperty(tmdb_id) for episodes and
    .setProperty(tvshow.tmdb_id) for shows for TMDBHelper
    support of lookup.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed bookmark issue mismatch in databse.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.6.9 - May 20, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new source filtering option "File Size limit (GB)".
    This is off by default.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed random case of fetching foreign landscape
    from fanart.tv.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added database table check to avoid bogus log errors.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue if user cleared Provider cache and then
    selected Rescrape the table was now empty and halted scraping.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Because of the changes to item #2 and 3 above the
    setting option "Allow Rescrape to first clear item providers"
    has now been removed and hard coded as the default.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.6.7 - May 14, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Library .strm playback. Previous update added ability
    to compare meta received from tmdbhelper vs. Venom's
    cached meta and use the largest.  I neglected that .strm
    files are also player files and meta sent is None type. Now
    I compare this as well and if the item is cached that meta
    is now used vs. scraped meta saved locally, which is more
    limited than Venom's cached meta.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.6.6 - May 14, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Remove HVAC and Remove 3D options.
    Previousely there would be random failures if specific
    free hosters were enabled.  Some free hosters were
    missing 'info' keys in the sources dict.  This has been
    fixed in both Venom and missing keys added to
    OpenScrapers.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.6.5 - May 12, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option to disable Cloudflare
    protected providers due to recent challenge failures.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reorganized all settings under "Source Options"
    to better follow the flow of scraping from start to results.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all Source filtering options to be "Remove"
    options.  Previously options were "Enable" or "Remove"
    and this just seems to be cleaner.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option "Allow Rescrape to first
    clear item providers".  Previously Rescrape would only
    cache new providers and read in previously cached providers.
    Now you have the option to make Rescrape fully start from
    scratch for the selected item.  This option will only clear
    provider links for the item you are selecting, this is not a full "Clear
    Providers" built in function.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Improved scrape time.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added IMDBNUMBER to episode InfoLabels for a4ksubtitles.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Improved meta data handling to deal with TMDBHELPER's
    limited meta exchange.  Now the Venomplayer will look in
    the Venom cache and compare against the meta received
    from TMDBHELPER and use the larger of the two.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed context menu "Clear All Cache" and replaced in
    movies and episodes with "Clear Providers".  Sorry
    folks but really frowning upon clearing of metacache.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Submitted new player files to TMDBHELPER.  Now there is
    two.."Venom (Auto Play)" and 'Venom (Source Select)".
    be sure to update TMDBHELPER's players.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting to enable or disable Calendar
    (TVMaze) extended meta.  When disabled(default)
    the Calendar list items will now load faster without
    the extra meta and artwork.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] resolveURL is now maintained by gural so
    repo has been updated.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.9 - March 30, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed resolveURL notification from previous
    update.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Updated bookmarks caching method to now also
    record show name and year for better tracking of
    progress indicators.  This requires you to clear old
    bookmarks for the new update to be in use.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.8 - March 29, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with random innacurate seasoncount.[/I]

    Season0 at end of users watch list. This would
    alter the Next Up-Progress item.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed trakt api episode count not including
    Season0 when enabled. This would cause shows
    to vanish from Trakt Progress when the count was
    exceeded.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added color setting for Movies who's theatrical
    release date is greater than current date.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.6 - March 20, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed torrent cache check for when debrid service
    is anything other than PM or RD it would drop other service.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Movies-In Theaters. Some group advanced
    filtering is currently no longer working on IMDB.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.5 - March 19, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Dialog source select now respects setting for
    "Multiline Source list" like Directory source list.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to "Sort torrents by size".  The new

    display as std info or magnet title.  Note this is skin
    dependent so secondary info line lengthens and
    should be tested with your skin of choice.  The
    new setting is under Source Options-Secondary
    Line Torrent content.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.3 - March 16, 2020[/COLOR][/B]

    own key in youtube addon.  That key will now take
    priority.[/I]

    for RD and PM. The new settings are found under
    "Torrent Settings" and are enabled by default to
    cache check and remove uncached torrents.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to not log removed duplicate sources.
    Logging the removed duplicates was causing
    excessive log spamming.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trailer module updated with new api keys to fix google
    search of youtube for trailers[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed how restarting a previousely watched movie
    or episode is handled. Previousely the title would be
    marked unwatched upon replaying a previousely
    watched item. Now the watched indicator is not
    changed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added ability to pass to skin resume points.  This now
    allows for skin to use a watched progress indicator.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDB Box Office to Movie Menu and
    setting page option to remove item from navigation.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.5.1 - Feb. 8, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Scraper function cache now written to the providers.db
    instead of cache.db.  Now using "Clear Providers" will
    wipe both links and function cache with no need to use
    "Clear cache". This will help preserve meta data.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Updated "context.venom" addon to now include the
    following new global context options as follows.
    "Clear Providers"
    "Find Similar"

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.9 - Feb. 3, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Trakt Progress fix to resolve random incorrect NextUp
    items to watch due to TVDB v1 api season/episodes out
    of order in xml.  The xml sort order was changed to be
    based on ID's and no longer sorted by season/episode.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added translation lookup for title and plot when language
 changed from English.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.8 - Jan. 27, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed query check for TVDB SeriesName and IMDB_ID
    for a more accurate title match for missing ID's .[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Revert solely to using requests.get() for 1-23 changes
    to TVDB legacy SSL support.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] fanart.tv module changed to using requests.get() with
    added response checks[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added notification for fanart.tv requests when server
    errors occur.  I suggest upon seeing this notification to
    disable extended artwork to combat the server
    errors until normal operation resumes.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.7 - Jan. 21, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to check for Venom updates at
    startup. Useful for those that turn off Auto Updates.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to enable-disable resolution icons
    in source select dialog.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added sort() method to TV Shows-Network
    (TVMaze) to maintain consistency with TVMaze api
    response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed Library import method from reading
    selected item to now fetch new meta.  This now better
    respects on the fly changes made to "Enable Special
    Season(0) and "Show unaired season/episodes".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New TVDB api key in use.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.6 - Jan. 16, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Another fix for this weeks TVDB change to SSL.
    Seems this week some shows are back to working with
    legacy SSL support while others do not.  What this now
    means is urllib2.urlopen() request works for some shows
    while requests.get() works for others.  When the request
    does not satisfy the SSL requirement the response xml's
    are empty yet server still responds with <Response 200>
    I've now coded a check for the first request and if the xml's
    are empty then we'll use requests.get().  This appears to now
    get all shows back to laoding season/episode lists.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed settings.xml typo from last update.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.5 - Jan. 11, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fix for TVDB latest change to SSL requirement.
    Thank you ruiner!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few settings tweaks for non Trakt users to hide
    options not pertaining to them.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Tools option to clean, remove old deprecated
    settings from userdata settings.xml.  New option will clean
    both Venom and OpenScrapers.  Please note that until
    OpenScrapers pushes the PR request this only works
    for Venom at this time.  Openscrapers update is coming
    for this to also work there.  This tool will also auto run
    upon new Venom update. Courtesy of FEN!![/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few tweaks to TV Shows - Networks to fix random
    dropped titles due to None types in api response.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.4 - Jan. 03, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Trakt watch/unwatched context menu options.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.3 - Jan. 02, 2020[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed loop issue with re-occurring library yes/no dialog.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.2 - Dec. 31, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Add Show to Watchlist" and "Remove Show
    from Watchlist" options to Trakt Manager when
    viewing seasons or episodes.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Hide Movie" or "Hide Show" options to Trakt
    Manager to hide from Progress and Calendar.  Use
    to cleanup within the addon folks!  Load time can be
    sped up cleaning out old itmes you may never finish
    a series of.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Made separate notifications settings for Trakt Server
    Notifications and General Notifications.  General Notifications
    covers Trakt Manager functions only and can now be turned
    off independently of Trakt Server/Timeout issues.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added widget refresh function for Trakt changes done
    within the addon.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed caching of Trakt Progress list so item changes
    are shown immediately.  This does cause reloading of Progress
    list to load no faster on subsequent loading of the list.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.1 - Dec. 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Trakt/TMDb list imports not adding "list_name"
    to database when imported from My Movies or My TVShows.
    This caused service update failures.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.4.0 - Dec. 26, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added 2nd notification to library folder check notification
    for auto folder setup.  Now if you answer "no" to the auto
    folder setup you will be presented with a 2nd yes-no dialog
    asking if you'd also like to disable the "Auto Update Service".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Update Service failure if no user lists were
    previously imported under the new system. The failure
    occurred because the db table was only written during
    the import process so service update checks did not
    find this table and halted the entire update process.
    This has been fixed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed occasional duplicate folder entries in the Kodi
    "MyVideos*.db" file.  This occurs because Kodi does
    not fully remove path table entries when manually
    deleted but instead Kodi zeroes out the values so it's
    not seen.  This has been fixed to remove those old
    entries when using the auto folder setup process.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed link caching process outside of Venom due
    to no global context menu to "Rescrape".  Global
    context menu options are in the works so this is a
    temp solution.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.9 - Dec. 23, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed broken for loop from previous update preventing
    Library Updates from completing.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Disney+ and Showcase to TVShows Networks.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.8 - Dec. 23, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Switched from Trakt slug check for ID's to Trakt IDLookup
    method. Slug checks seems to report same IMDB_ID
    but different TVDB_ID for some shows. IDLookup method
    is less prone to errors.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb Watchlist, Favorites, and Userlist to library
    import options for both Movies and TV Shows.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Happy Holidays to Everyone![/I

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.7 - Dec. 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added extra folder path check when comparing Venom
    library folders to Kodi's MyVideos*.db file.  Now 
    "special://userdata" and translated paths are both
    checked.  This solves issues with moved or manually
    added folders.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new sort function as a temporary workaround to
    solve the out of order Season Specials and Episode
    index problems from TVDb v1 api.  TVDb is aware
    of the condition.  Sadly this still does not fix the issues
    with Trakt-Progress being incorrect at times for next
    episode to watch, that problem occurs because the
    index is very often out of order so the wrong NextUp
    episode is grabbed.fried.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] If you do not use Venom's Library integration please
    disable the "Auto Update Service" under Settings-Library.
    The new library folder check and auto setup prompt now
    runs inside the existing service so it will cause the pop
    up notification for setup.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.6 - Dec. 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new function to move traceback error logging to
    addon log vs. kodi log.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added .setCast() to player.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added automated setup to add "Venom Library folders"
    to Kodi Sources under "Settings-Library".  A notice will
    also pop up requesting this automated setup if folders
    were not added to Kodi sources and you attempt to
    import lists to library.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added ability to Import Trakt user lists and liked lists for
    Movies and TV Shows. This is also added as a service
    to update any titles later added online to Trakt account.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] "Add to Library" and "Update Libray" now respect setting options
    for "Show Unaired" and "Season Special(Season0)".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added option to "Tools-Library" for "Clean Library".[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.5 - Dec. 02, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed typo effecting all IMDb TV Show lists not loading. Sorry folks
    was pretty sad seeing it.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.4 - Dec. 02, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed 40 item limit sent to resolveURL to now check all links till
    resolved link found. This will rid the "No stream available"
    notification seen after 40 links checked and not resolved[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "Shortcuts" to last category in Settings for faster access. Also
    changed setting query to not land on first item in 
    category so there is no need to arrow over and
    down to another category in Settings[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "Clear All Cache" to all context menu options.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed metacache issue due to trakt api having some shows with
    same tvdb_id but different imdb_id or tmdb_id.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Made all trakt lists now respect setting for "Season0" displayed or
    not displayed.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed issue with UpNext "Playback Failed" at start of 2nd item in
    playlist.[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed "Survivor bug" writing show to library but this in Venom
    is due to new profile data retrieved from tvdb for cast
    and profile pics that yielded 576 cast members for this
    show that proved to much for sql database write.  I've
    reduced max cast to 200 and cures it on Win and Shield
    so please let me know device specific if this still fails.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.3 - Nov. 24, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Sorry folks missed an entry in last update for TVDb name change[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.2 - Nov. 24, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVDb for changed xml file names....AGAIN![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.1 - Nov. 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVDb for new changed xml file names.  Please note TVDb is still not
    fully fixed on their end. On 11-16-19 I retrieved the
    xmls to discover many tags inside the files were
    missing data, or lacked closing tags, so looks like
    they have more updating to do.  Season posters
    are not working at this time from them and they're
    only providing a show poster.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting option to remove "CAM and SD sources".  Note this new
    option will only take place if better than
    "CAM and SD" sources exists to avoid nothing
    returned for links.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option to remove "3D sources".[/I]
COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting Category called "Shortcuts".  This now allows you to
    clear specific cache without backing out of menus
    and going into Tools. Call up "Venom Settings"
    and go to "Shortcuts" anywhere.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.3.0 - Oct 27, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Re-wrote TV Shows-Calendar (TVMaze). Hard coded shows air time
    to display and changed sort to match api response
    order for time aired.  Added extended artwork from
    fanart.tv. Added season.posters[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Addeed setting option "Direct Progress Scraping" for Trakt Progress list.
    This will now bypass the Trakt secondary progress episode list and begin
    scraping current selected episode instead.  Added
    context menu option "Browse Progress" for when
    new setting option is enabled to allow bypassing
    on the fly. Added new context menu option
    "Direct Progress Scrape" when new setting
    option is not enabled.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed episode ID ""None" type issue for occasional missing ids in Trakt
    api response during TV Show search when

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TVShow search results due to trakt api response duplicating
    shows with "None" type years, similar for Movies.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed Trakt OnDeck to follow intedended shortened version of
    "Unfinished" list, per api docs.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added resolution icons for source directory list, note not all skins support
    this and may not be seen.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed default sort for TVShows Calendar sorting to "Date Premiered".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added "season.poster" fallback when not available.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.7 - Oct 16, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more api languages in settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more provider languages in settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed episode "poster" to ""season.poster" to be
    more descriptive of the season you are viewing.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TMDb threading to "for" loop thread for 2nd
    api request and fanart.tv request.  Huge speed bump in menu load times.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Some tweaks to TMDb user list sorting.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb has now fixed user lists from dropping titles due to a lang issue.
    Thank you Travis!!![/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added more Navigation options to now cover most all.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed IMDb lists from local sort method to server request sorting.  This allows
    "Date Added" for IMDb lists to now work.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "My List" to Navigation settings.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Hard coded "Movie-Collections" sort order to release_date.asc. In the event user
    changes Movie sort to "Title" or "Date Added" this made more sense to keep a
    movie collection in order of release date, occurrence, in order as 1, 2 ,3 etc.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Moved "season count" and "unwatched count" to main "TV Shows" and out of
    UpNext settings, made no sense being there.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting to turn on notification sounds, now off by
    default for ALL.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added tvShort to IMDb url for Movie user lists.  This allows short films to be
    brought in to lists even if TV aired.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Aded IMDb "My Ratings" to "My Lists" for both Movies and TVShows.  Added
    filtering for both due to IMDb does not handle "title_type" for user Rating lists.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.2.5 - Oct 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb user lists to TVShows.[/I]

    calls to function.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added setting option to enable-disable duplicate sources returned.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new Trakt caching method to extend cache valid duration.  Now we check for
    a change in Trakt WatchedActivity occurs and refreshes Trakt list immediately.  If
    nothing new is watched cache can be held for a month until a change occurs.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.1.8 - Aug 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed actor profiles for Silvo skin, note that Silvo skin still has random issues with
    season count due to an ExtendedSeasonPanel that does not work well with 3rd
    party addons so best to disable the season count option.  I do have a modded
    Silvo file to cure the problem if needed.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed TMDb random extended artwork drops.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed fanart.tv api call to threaded request for TMDb Movies as experimental

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Watched indicator improvements.  Still it seems Kodi has
    random failures causing you to back out and go
    back in. Episode watched indicators were
    previously broken due to some typos, that is
    now fixed.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.3 - July 07, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed UpNext broken if using new option to "Disable
    Extended artwork".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed fanart.tv request when using IMDb.  It seems fanart.tv
    has been dropping some title ID's so the response
    would not return any artwork.  Perfect example is
    Bohemian Rhapody.  Two weeks ago this title had
    plenty of extended artwork and now it's gone.  Upon
    reviewing the api call the TMDb_ID is still there but
    IMDb has been removed.  Now I check for this and
    pass TMDb ID if "error" in api response.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.2 - July 06, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed IMDb user key issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new option to "Disable Extended artwork(fanart.tv).
    This helps shorten some menu load times at the loss
    of extra poster, extra fanart, clearart and discart.  I've
    set this up to gather at a min poster and fanart from
    either IMDb, TMDb, or TVDb.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed some setting options from "enum" type to
    "select" type.  Instead of having to arrow through the
    options you will now have a pop up list to show you
    all available options in one shot. Options with only
    2 items I left as "enum" type.[/I]
[B][COLOR red]Update - v3.0.1 - July 03, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Removed caching of Trakt Progress list. Data should now

    Best seen with Aura skin.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new setting option "Page Item Limit".  You can now
    set the number of list items per page for Movies and
    TV Shows. Note TMDb api default left at 20 so this
    new option works for IMDb and Trakt lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed occasional File Lock issue under
    some conditions.[/I]

    style based on Traditional icons or Meta Provider Logos.

    item .. ex (TMDb).  This helps distinguish between.. ex
    "Popular (IMDb) and Popular (TMDb)[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed old depreciated infoLabel that effected some
    menus showing the watched indicator when in fact the
    episode was not watched. Most notable was Trakt
    Progress. This made the side panel options work in
    reverse when flipping watched to unwatched.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added traceback to a number of new locations.

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.7 - June 22, 2019[/COLOR][/B]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed resume bookmark to yes-no dialog to deal
    with occasional bug in contextmenu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a notification when you stop a movie, or episode,
    that a resume point, and timestamp, was saved if bookmarks are enabled[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed functionality of Episode counters.  Previously if
    you watched an entire season the season list would change
    to a watched indicator only.  Now the episode count will be
    remain visible regardless of watch count.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed Special Seasons, or Season 0, from not being displayed.
    Adjusted episode counter to take this Season 0 into account for
    totals[/I]

    directory type list items.  You can add, remove, view playlist,
    and clear entire playlist.  For directory list items I added the
    playlist viewer and playlist clear options.  I suggest using
    the existing "Add to playlist" option for full shows and seasons[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.3 - May 28, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Source list now utilizes multiline list items. Settings

    to remove duplicate links broke if no debrid account.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added discart to movies from fanart.tv[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Trakt "Box Office" to movies.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] added Navigation controls to settings page to
    turn off dupliacte movie and tv shows from IMDb, TMDb, and Trakt.
    May add more.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.9.1 - May 19, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Switched startup notice from news to changelog. Should
   have been done in 2.9.0 but missed it.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed some broken artwork and studio info for TV Shows "Networks".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added clearart and clearlogo to "Networks". Will display in player.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Trakt watched sync as startup service if valid account.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.8 - May 18, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Reworked TV Show Networks. I discovered that all exo forks parse the
     tvmaze web page titled "This seasons Shows".  If your expecting to find a show
    like HBO's Boardwalk Empire you won't because it's ended, or discontinued. I've
    modified this to parse not only that web page but also the page for "All shows".
    There is now a settings page option to control which method you'd like.  The new
    "All shows" brings in allot more now.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Previous update I adjusted the artwork retrieved to be based
    on like count but only tackled movies at the time.  TV Shows is now included.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.7 - May 16, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few more cache duration tweaks.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a few new TV Networks, Hulu long overdue.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] A big redo of Fanart.tv retrieved artwork.  Artwork is now retrieved based
     on number of likes received as priority throughout.  This means artwork could
    occasionally change.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] updated TMDb's api for soon to be phased out "releases" query parameter,
    replaced by "release_dates".  This updated a good deal of titles certificate/ratings[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.6 - May 14, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks for TV shows this time.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb TV Shows and the results
    are more trustworthy. This allowed me to tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs
    without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb's Upcoming to Movie menu[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed TMDb Movie Collections to use new tmdb.py indexer[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.5 - May 12, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More TMDb api tweaks. Extended artwork was causing a failure for some titles
    and list return was not the 20 items, TMDb provides, who's noticed? Extended fanart
    was braking 1-2 titles per page.  That's resolved and each Movie page now yields
    20 items from api response.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Done away with worker() and super_info() for TMDb movies at this time and the
    results are more trustworthy, TV Shows next then onto IMDb. This allowed me to
    tweak the cache duration time to 24hrs without issue[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] 4k fanart inclusion, previously only 1920 width was allowed and lately many titles
    are 4k fanart only so this was a must change as I noticed the decrease in fanart in
    the interface.  May cause a slight lag and considering adding a 4k fanart option to
    turn this off. Downside is  you will lose some if you turn it off so it's hard coded for
    now as always on[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.4 - May 9, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Few TMDb api fixes for missing meta.  Some genre and mpaa cases were dropped
    due to format issues. Some TV Shows runtime/duration returned  more than one
    value so now we index just the first case and this stops seeing "0".[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new request function to add a sleep/wait state for TMDB's api to limit the
    number of pop up notifications when rate-limiter is hit.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] More code changes and soon the infamous worker() and super_info() functions
    will be gone. They break as many list items as they create![/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.3 - May 8, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to TV Shows.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40
    list items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please
    wait! Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in TV Show lists to indicate IMDb, Trakt,or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added Dutch language choice to api[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Fixed thread issue with large User/Watch lists[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] TMDb now has it's own py file and as I move towards separate files for indexing
    TMDb, Trakt, IMDb, and TVDb I have chosen to store these files in the "Indexers"
    folder. As a result all menu navigation py files have been moved to a new "Menu"
    folder.  Some old files were not removed in last update and this has now been
    corrected.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.2 - May 7, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added TMDb api lists to movies.  Please note TMDb's api is rate limited to 40 list
    items per 10 seconds.  I've added a notification if you hit this limit and to please wait!
    Other wise next page load is not possible till timer expires.  Not my rules!
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Changed all icons in movies list to indicate IMDb, Trakt, or TMDb for better
    knowledge where list is coming from.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] I may scrap all efforts on future TMDb development as I'm not impressed with the
    rate limiter issue and honestly the lists are near identical to IMDb so what's the freakin
    point other than a cluttered interface?! Opinions  welcome!  So it's not yielding brownie
    points thus far with me.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.8.1 - May 3, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Now using Openscrapers for source providers! Torrent min  seeder option now part
    of Openscraper settings.[/I]

    been removed[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] New Notification function for additional info.  Default InfoDialog() reported
    Addon Name as heading/Title, and now reports Movie, show, or Episode info if added to
    Trakt etc.  Also turned off annoying sounds for anything other than errors.[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.9 - April 29, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added new options to Trakt Manager, Watched, Unwatched, Rate, and Unrate.
    Main function of List items now in Bold and Color to stand out[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Play" options.  Now when set to "Auto Play". Then
    context menu will have option called "Source Select" to override "AutoPlay", formerly
    "Play using..", made little sense what the function did. Works  in reverse if default play
    action is "Directory" you'll see "Auto Play"  as usual[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Renamed context menu "Queue Item" to "Add to Playlist" to better follow suit
    with new playlist options coming soon[/I]

[B][COLOR red]Update - v2.7.8 - April 26, 2019[/COLOR][/B]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Scaper fix, 3 Torrents fixed.  Due to number of links being pulled default is now
